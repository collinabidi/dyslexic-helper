Created for Tartanhacks 2020

Built using Python, Pytorch, OpenCV, pytesseract modules and CRAFT-pytorch.

People with dyslexia sometimes aren't able to read important text in public places, such as safety instructions,
lecture notes, and street signs.

This application simply takes a picture provided by the user, detects regions with text, extracts the text, and re-displays
the image with captions written in dyslexic-accessible font.

Easy as pie!
